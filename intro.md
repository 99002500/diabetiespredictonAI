# Libraries used:
##  Pandas
-> Stands for python data analysis library
-> Takes CSV file or SQL database and creates a python object with rows and columns called data frame that looks very similar to a table in a statistical software.
-> To use pandas import pandas library first.

### Viewing and inspecting data
-> Since data is loaded into dataframe, we can look into it

-> To get first n rows, we have to do df.head(n) and to get last n rows we have to do df.tail(n)

-> df.shape-  gives number of rows and columns.

## sklearn
-> Library which supports various algorithms like support vector mahcine, random forests and k neighbours and it also supports numerical and scientific libraries like numpy and scipy.
